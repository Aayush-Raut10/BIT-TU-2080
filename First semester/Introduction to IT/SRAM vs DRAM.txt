SRAM
- static RAM
- faster speed
- consumes less power than DRAM
- occupies more space
- refresh circuit is not required
- 6 transistors are needed to form one memory cell
- expensive
- used as cache memory

DRAM
- dynamic RAM
- less speed than SRAM
- consumes more power than SRAM
- occupies less space
- refresh circuit is required
- only 1 transistors are needed to form one memory cell
- less expensive than SRAM
- used as primary memory (RAM)
